## Generate a Progressive Web project

To generate a Progressive Web project, run the following command in the terminal:

```
bash <(curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobify/generator-progressive-web/master/generate.sh)
```

Note for Windows users: this requires [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), and thus does not work in a regular Command prompt. You will need to install git and use the Git Bash terminal and run this command there.
